# To Complete

Show graphics for all modules
Graphics repr. decoupled from actual module
Make sure internal processing is always at 96Khz or more (remove hi quality button)
Need to connect more mod destinations
Chorus

# Rework and features

Polymorphic oscillators
Add 4th oscillator
Add at least one more modulator
Make LFO and Envelope output of modulators available as sources
Add Osc Envelopes
Individual Glide modifier per oscillator
Tracking and base Frequency per oscillator - remove existing key Track button
Add FM synthesis section - new tab where the mixer is.
1>1 1>2 1>3 1>4
    2>2 2>3 2>4
        3>3 3>4
            4>4

Make the AM options separate feeds into the mixer
re-think mixing between stages (character/HP/LP filter) - would be good to get output straight from each stage
Add a properly, actually, zero delay filter with root finding.
Generalize the oscillator block to allow more types of oscs
Add granular synthesis
Add supersaw oscillator
Make the editor one-instance only
improve UDP communication so that new plugin instances notify the editor of their existence

# DSP Improvements

Parameter smoothing (is it necesary? why is the update rate so bad?)
Replace HP Filter with ZDF State variable version

# Bugs for later

Make sure you can't crash the plugin by sending bogus OSC parameters
Warn user if loading preset with missing wavetable.

# Unfinushed features

Filter mode for TrueZero filter
